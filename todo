- [ ] Get the first test running just to see if `copy_folder` works as expected
- [ ] Once that is done, fix the generic driver implementation to look more like modern python
- [ ] Add type-hints and pydantic models for better input validation
- [ ] Add unit-tests to quickly test the individual components themselves and not only in an end-to-end fashion
